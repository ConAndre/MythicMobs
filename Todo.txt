try for player fix
Get rid of flat damage
Add variety enchants for diversity/Reroll possibility


Reroll concept:
Have player hold 6 reroll essence in offhand.
~onUse > Check if player has 6 > Remove 6 > and reroll main hand using skill
You can do conditions for certain reroll essence.
- holding{m=diamond_sword} true
That way you can make armor essence, sword essence, axe essence, bow essence. Cool content

Reroll concept again:
Player farms for fragments
6 + Armor shard = Armor Reroll
6 + Axe shard = Axe Reroll
6 + Sword shard = Sword Reroll
6 + Bow shard = Bow Reroll
6 + Crossbow shard = Crossbow Reroll

AGain again :
If player uses item with name Armor token

Make a logging system for consumables (dupe checker)
THru java ofc not mythic mobs log on item use

Bossshoppro fucking sucks:
try using %item_in_hand% to give/take player item (simulates a reroll)


Shields:
